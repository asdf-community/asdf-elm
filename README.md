## Prerequirements

- Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
  - curl
  - git
  - gunzip

## Installation

```bash
asdf plugin-add elm https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-elm.git
```

## Usage

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions on how to
install & manage versions.

## Useful information

asdf uses the `.tool-versions` for auto-switching between software versions. To
ease migration, you can have it read `elm.json` or `elm-package.json` file to
find out what version of Elm should be used. This only works with the exact
version. To do this, add the following to `~/.asdfrc`:

```
legacy_version_file = yes
```
